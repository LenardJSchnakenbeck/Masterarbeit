\subsubsection{How are the participants learning texts (ideally)?}
Quintessenz, Eselsbrücken, an bestehendem Wissen anknüpfen, Geschichte überlegen

wichtigste sachen markieren, von oben nach unten
nochmal selber aufschreiben (per Hand)

paraphrasieren, Keynotes (zusammenfassen)



\subsubsection{When are questions expertise demanding? When not?}

complex topic, asking for information that were not understood, asking for specifics/details

technical terms, puzzled (bad) questions, language-problems, asking for more knowledge, detailed knowledge
low expertise-demanding: yes/no questions, questions asking for information from the beginning of the text, broad knowledge

many (different) information in Answerspan, asking for details, closely connected information (risk of confusion), open question (depending on expectations)
low ed: simple information


\subsubsection{How do the participants assess relevance and plausibility of false alternatives as predictors?}

makes sense, having false alternatives is a property of the text

relevance yes, but plausibility of false alternatives no, (maybe in certain cases)

mentioned both by himself



\subsubsection{How do the participants create and order questions?}

cover the whole amount of information, put things in comparison, linking with personal experience

/

mixing simple and open questions, funny questions, varying/mixing difficulties and selecting difficulty for target group (multimedial \& interactive)



\subsubsection{How would the participants order the questions?}

keeping the same order (to remember better), ask for general concept, then specifics, grouping questions (bringing things in context to each other)

chronological (if the text has good structure, but actually) sorted by complexity, or chronological for historical events. sorted by topic, (((or causality))).

varying the order randomly (to avoid learning the order instead of question-answer relationship)
