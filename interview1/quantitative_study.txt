Text-based Metric for Expertise Demand of Answerspans for Question Generation

Automatic Question Generators (AQG) are models that get a text with a marked Answerspan as input and give a question
that can be answered with the marked Answerspan as output. E.g.
I want to develop / test a metric that scores such Answerspans based on Expertise-Demand.
The metric answers the question
"How much expertise about the text is needed to answer a question about a certain answerspan?"
The Metric is Text-based, which means it focusses on one text only, regardless if it is a simple or sophisticated Text.
Also this metric should be as objective as possible.
So influences that affect the difficulty to retrieve information from a text that differ between individuals should be neglected.
E.g. specific previous knowledge, memorizing strategies, cultural background and of course situational aspects.

Do you understand the objective of the metric?
Do you think you can judge phrases in a text based on their expertise-demand?


Rank the following Answerspans in the text "TEXTNAME" based on expertise demand.
The Answerspan with the lowest expertise demand gets value 0 and the highest value 10.
